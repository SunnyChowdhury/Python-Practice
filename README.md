# Python Coding Practice 🐍

Welcome to my Python coding practice repo!  
This is a personal space where I strengthen my fundamentals for coding — one problem at a time.

## 🧠 Purpose

As a QA/SDET/Software professional, I’m using this repo to:
- Build muscle memory with Python
- Practice clean logic and core problem-solving patterns

## 💡 What You’ll Find

- ✅ Basic Python logic and syntax exercises
- ✅ Interview-style problems (e.g. palindrome, FizzBuzz, duplicates, factorial, prime numbers)
- ✅ Data structure use-cases (lists, strings, arrays, recursion, loops)
- ✅ My solutions and experiments — continuously improving

## 🚀 Goals

- Grow into a confident engineer and problem solver

## 🤝 Open to Feedback

If you're viewing this repo and have suggestions on improving readability, structure, or Pythonic best practices — feel free to open an issue or share a comment.

Thanks for checking this out!
